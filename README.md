# Zip-steganography-using-Java
Today,  the  security  is  getting  the  major attention due to the increased use of internet. As the use of  internet  is  increased,  the  rate  at  which  the  data  is exchanged  per  day  is  also  increased.  The  data  that  is exchanged every day may become the victim of hackers. To deal with this problem one of the effective solution is the Steganography. The Steganography is a way to hide secret  information  behind  an  innocent  cover  file,  such that the existence of information is not usually recognized. 

The rapid growth  of internet  makes the daily life much easier for human beings. Some examples which illustrate  the use  of internet  are  –the most  used  online shopping  facility,  online  bill  payment,  online  money transactions, booking  online tickets, online  recharge etc. The  other  part  of  facility  which  mostly  affected  the human  lives  is  social  networking  sites  like  facebook, twitter, instagram, what‟s app etc. Due to this facility the peoples  are  sharing  their  important  information, documents  with  the  other  person.  People  share  their private and secret data with the other person through the internet.  Transferring private  data  through internet  may become  a  victim  of  hackers.  So  security  is  upmost important  while sending  the data  through internet.

The word steganography is derived from the Greek words steganos (meaning hidden or covered) and the Greek root graph (meaning to write).Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content; the data to be hidden can be hidden inside almost any other type of digital content. The content to be concealed through steganography -- called hidden text -- is often encrypted before being incorporated into the innocuous-seeming cover text file or data stream. If not encrypted, the hidden text is commonly processed in some way in order to increase the difficulty of detecting the secret content. In steganography we also cryptography for encryption or decryption of data.

So to overcome this problems we used zip-steganography-using-java in this we use the file compressing alogrithm through which we can keep our data safe by compressing it and hidding behind the video this is more secure way to keep our data safe and secret through this software we compress our data file with the video and send it securely. In this we are using the video to hide our data.

Steps to Encrypt the data:-
1. First we select the data file which we want to hide.
2. Then we select the video file behind which we want to hide the data.
3. Then we click on the encrypt button

Steps to Decrypt the data:-
1.To decrypt the data we select the encrypted file from the folder.
2.Then we click on the decrypt buttton .

Note:- To see the Encrypted or Decrypted files you have go to the encrytion or decryption folder which are automatically made in your drive.
